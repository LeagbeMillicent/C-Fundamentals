# C-Fundamentals
#First-Code:
{Console.WriteLine("Hello World!");}

Click the Run button:
It compiles the code into an executable format that a computer can understand.
It runs the compiled application and, when written correctly, will output "Hello World!".

#Some errors that can occur
1. Case sensitivity
   a. console.writeline("Hello World"); // This is wrong
   b. Console.writeline("Hello World"); // This too is wrong
2. The use of single-quotation marks (') to surround the literal string Hello World! will throw an error
3. Not adding the semi-Colon .

# Commenting codes
adding comment to codes using two forward slashes // tells the computer not to run that code.

# "Write" and "WriteLine"
//Write
Console.Write("Congratulations!");
Console.Write(" ");
Console.Write("You wrote your first lines of code.");

//Output 
"Congratulations! You wrote your first lines of code."

//WriteLine
Console.WriteLine("Congratulations!");
Console.Write("You wrote your first lines of code.");

//OutPut
Congratulations!
You wrote your first lines of code.
